### Profile {#profile}

I’m Piasy (建林，许). I receive my Bachelor degree on Computer Science in Tsinghua University. Now I'm doing Android development at YOLO, a mobile live streaming app. I appreciate technology, love technology, and enjoy dealing real-life challenge, improving productivity, and making life more colorful, with technology. Now I’m focusing on Android development, but my sight will never be limited in it, instead I’ll be excited to know awesome technologies in every field. I do believe what one of my mentor in college said: We are not genius, but we could become more excellent than most of others with harder working. And I am now on my way to become an expert. My dev blog is [http://blog.piasy.com/](http://blog.piasy.com/), and my GitHub profile is [https://github.com/Piasy/](https://github.com/Piasy/).

### Skills {#skills}

* Android Development
  : 2 years practice on app development, with solid experience about architecture, TDD, reactive programming, RESTful API call, data management, custom view and interaction, and performance tuning. Now I'm thinking more deeply about software engineering and project management.

* Golang web backend
  : Some experience about building RESTful API server, TDD and database design. I'v built two RESTful API servers with Beego framework, storing data in MongoDB and MySQL database.

* React & React Native
  : Just start learning and doing some practice. The advantage of learn once, write everywhere is very compeling to me.
