<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong><br />
<br />
I’m Piasy (Jianlin Xu), a fullstack hacker, open source fan, and knowledge sharer. My development experiences cover Android, iOS, Windows, TX2, and backend, and I’m focusing on RTC technology currently, both client side and server side. I have 1.9K followers on GitHub, and projects with about 10K stars in total. I gave many talks on technical conferences, including a good model &amp; network layer architecture in Android application on GDG Beijing meetup, and RxJava on Droidcon Beijing, 2016. I graduated from the best University in China, Tsinghua University, majored in CS. My book, which is the first technical book explaining details inside WebRTC and WebRTC development on native platforms in the world, is publishing. My dev blog is <a href="https://blog.piasy.com/">https://blog.piasy.com/</a>, and my GitHub profile is <a href="https://github.com/Piasy/">https://github.com/Piasy/</a>.</p>
