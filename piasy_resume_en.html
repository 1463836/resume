<p><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong><br />
<br />
I’m Piasy (Jianlin Xu). I receive my Bachelor degree on Computer Science in Tsinghua University at 2015. Now I’m leading the client SDK team at PowerInfo. I appreciate technology, and enjoy dealing real-life challenge with technology. I’m focusing on RTC technology currently, but my sight will never be limited in it. I think solving valuable problems with team members, efficiently and reliably, is the most important thing when building a product. To achieve this, critical thinking, ability to learn new things, and collaborating with others are key points. My dev blog is <a href="https://blog.piasy.com/">https://blog.piasy.com/</a>, and my GitHub profile is <a href="https://github.com/Piasy/">https://github.com/Piasy/</a>.</p>
